## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

The following optmizations were done to index.html to attain a pagespeed score > 90.
1. Eliminated render-blocking JavaScript and CSS.
2. Used web font loader for google font families.
3. Optimized the pizzeria and profile pic images.

The following optimizations were done to main.js for renderng pizza.html at 60 fps.
1. Optimized updatePositions functions by
	a. Moved calculations that remain constant outside the for 	loop.
	b. Fetching the array of sliding pizzas outside the for 	loop.
	b. Used requestAnimationFrame to call updatePositions 	function. 
2.	Reduced the number of sliding pizzas in the background.
3.	Moved the sliding pizzas to separate layer to reduce 	paint.
The pizza resize function was also optimized to take less than 5 ms.
